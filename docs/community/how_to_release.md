This document mainly introduces how the release manager releases a new version of Apache Fury.

## Introduction

Source Release is the most important part which Apache values.

Please pay more attention to license and signing issues.
Publishing software is a serious thing and has legal consequences.

## First-time as a release manager

### Environmental requirements

This release process is operated in the Ubuntu OS, and the following tools are required:

- JDK 1.8
- Apache Maven 3.x
- Python 3.8
- GnuPG 2.x
- Git
- SVN (apache uses svn to host project releases)
- Pay attention to setting environment variables: if you configure gpg keys under a different directory, please `export GNUPGHOME=$(xxx)`

### Prepare GPG Key

If you are the first to become a release manager, you need to prepare a gpg key.

Following is a quick setup, you can refer to [Apache openpgp doc](https://infra.apache.org/openpgp.html) for further details.

#### Install GPG

```bash
sudo apt install gnupg2
```

#### Generate GPG Key

Please use your apache name and email for generate key

```bash
$ gpg --full-gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.20; Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1 # input 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096 # input 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0 # input 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y # input y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Chaokun Yang                   # input your name
Email address: chaokunyang@apache.org     # input your email
Comment: CODE SIGNING KEY                 # input some annotations, optional
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Chaokun <chaokunyang@apache.org>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O # input O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa4096 2022-07-12 [SC]
      1E2CDAE4C08AD7D694D1CB139D7BE8E45E580BA4
uid           [ultimate] Chaokun <chaokunyang@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2022-07-12 [E]
```

#### Upload your public key to public GPG keyserver

Firstly, list your key:

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

The output is like:

```
--------------------------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2024-03-27 [SC]
      1E2CDAE4C08AD7D694D1CB139D7BE8E45E580BA4
uid           [ultimate] chaokunyang (CODE SIGNING KEY) <chaokunyang@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2024-03-27 [E]
```

Then, send your key id to key server:

```bash
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-key <key-id> # e.g., 1E2CDAE4C08AD7D694D1CB139D7BE8E45E580BA4
```

Among them, `keys.openpgp.org` is a randomly selected keyserver, you can use keyserver.ubuntu.com or any other full-featured keyserver.

#### Check whether the key is created successfully

Uploading takes about one minute; after that, you can check by email at the corresponding keyserver.

Uploading keys to the keyserver is mainly for joining a [Web of Trust](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#web-of-trust).

#### Add your GPG public key to the project KEYS file

The svn repository of the release branch is: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/fury

Please add the public key to KEYS in the release branch:

```bash
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/fury fury-dist
# As this step will copy all the versions, it will take some time. If the network is broken, please use svn cleanup to delete the lock before re-execute it.
cd fury-dist
(gpg --list-sigs YOUR_NAME@apache.org && gpg --export --armor YOUR_NAME@apache.org) >> KEYS # Append your key to the KEYS file
svn add .   # It is not needed if the KEYS document exists before.
svn ci -m "add gpg key for YOUR_NAME" # Later on, if you are asked to enter a username and password, just use your apache username and password.
```

#### Upload the GPG public key to your GitHub account

- Enter https://github.com/settings/keys to add your GPG key.
- Please remember to bind the email address used in the GPG key to your GitHub account (https://github.com/settings/emails) if you find "unverified" after adding it.

## Start discussion about the release

Start a discussion about the next release via sending email to: dev@fury.apache.org:

Title:

```
[DISCUSS] Release Apache Fury(incubating) ${release_version}
```

Content:

```
Hello, Apache Fury(incubating) Community,

This is a call for a discussion to release Apache Fury(incubating) version ${release_version}.

The change lists about this release:

https://github.com/apache/fury/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0

Please leave your comments here about this release plan. We will bump the version in repo and start the release process after the discussion.

Thanks,

${name}
```

## Preparing for release

If the discussion goes positive, you will need to prepare the release artifiacts.

### Github branch and tag

- Create a new branch named `releases-0.5.0`
- Bump version to `$version` by executing command `python ci/release.py -l all -version $version`
- Make a git commit and push the branch to `git@github.com:apache/fury.git`
- Create a new tag by `git tag v0.5.0-rc1`, then push it to `git@github.com:apache/fury.git`

### Build and upload artifacts to SVN dist/dev repo

First you need to build source release artifacts by `python ci/release.py build -v $version`.

Then you need to upload it to svn dist repo. The dist repo of the dev branch is: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/fury

```bash
# As this step will copy all the versions, it will take some time. If the network is broken, please use svn cleanup to delete the lock before re-execute it.
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/fury fury-dist-dev
```

Then, upload the artifacts:

```bash
cd fury-dist-dev
# create a directory named by version
mkdir ${release_version}-${rc_version}
# copy source code and signature package to the versioned directory
cp ${repo_dir}/dist/* ${release_version}-${rc_version}
# check svn status
svn status
# add to svn
svn add ${release_version}-${rc_version}
# check svn status
svn status
# commit to SVN remote server
svn commit -m "Prepare for fury ${release_version}-${rc_version}"
```

Visit https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/fury/ to check the artifacts are uploaded correctly.

### What to do if something goes wrong

If some files are unexpected, you need to remove by `svn delete` and repeat the above upload process.

## Voting
