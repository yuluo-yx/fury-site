:::info

**This release was made before Fury joined the Apache Incubator and thus it's a non-ASF release.**

:::

I'm so excited to announce the 0.2.0 release of the Fury. This a very exciting version of fury. With this version, we have 1X speedup, `30%~50%` smaller serialized size. And now we are the fastest serialization framework in the [JVM-Serializers](https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki). At the same time, fury has fully support for JDK17/21, I supported JDK17+ record JIT serialization, JDK9+ ImmutableList JIT serialization. The serialization is blazing fast, please try it out. And we also open sourced Fury GO, the first golang serialization framework which supports circular reference and interface polymorphismm, feel free to try it out and let me know if you have any issues.
