I'm excited to release Fury v0.1.0 . Fury 0.1.0 is our first release since we started the development in github in 2023.04.28, and open sourced in 2023.07.15.

In this release we closed 314 issues, 412 PRs, and we have 5 new contributors. Thanks for their contributions to fury, looking forward to further cooperation with them.

This release includes many features, see more details on https://github.com/alipay/fury/releases/tag/v0.1.0:

- Production-ready java serialization:
  - Highly optimized Java serialization primives
  - Runtime codegen framework
  - Interpreter mode java serialization
  - JIT accelerated serializer for java serialization
  - Support async and multi-thread JIT
  - Support type forward-backward compatibility.
  - Support meta sharing to send class meta only once.
  - Support JDK custom serialization on fury natively.
  - Out-of-band zero-copy serialization for java
- Cross language Serialization
  - Support basic types cross-language between java/python/javascript/rust
  - Support struct cross-language automatically, no need for IDL definition
  - Supports shared and circular reference object serialization between java/python/javascript.
  - Support object polymorphism between java/python/javascript.
  - Out-of-band zero-copy serialization between java/python
- Row format
  - Support row format between java/python/c++.
  - Support lazy/partial deserialization.
  - Support convert to arrow format automatically.

With this release, we take big strides towards our goal of making serialization fast, cross-language, unified and open.
For details, please refer to the following commit messages.

Note that javascript/rust support is still experimental, please let us know if you have any issues.
