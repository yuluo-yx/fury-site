The Apache Fury team is pleased to announce the 0.6.0 release. This is a major release that includes [35 PR](https://github.com/apache/fury/compare/v0.5.1...v0.6.0) from 12 distinct contributors. See the [Install](https://fury.apache.org/docs/start/install) Page to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

## High light

In this release, we introduced a scoped meta share mode for schema evolution in java and enabled it by default when `CompatibleMode` is set to `Compatible`:

- This mode is **50%** faster than previous KV compatible mode, and only **1/6** size of serialized payload than before.
- It's **4x** faster than protobuf, less than **1/2** serialized size of protobuf for complex object.

</p>

Protobuf/JSON will write message fields meta and values in a KV layout, so when serializzing a list of message, they will have two issues:

- Write meta multiple times even those message are the same type.
- KV layout is dispersive, which is not friendly for compression.

The meta share mode will write  field name&type meta of a struct only once for multiple objects of same type, which will save space and improve performance comparedto protobuf.

With meta share, we can write field name&type meta of a struct only once for multiple objects of same type, which will save space and improve performance comparedto protobuf. And we can also encode the meta into binary in advance, and use one memory copy to write it which will be much faster.

### Serialize data

```java
  public static class NumericStruct {
    public int f1;
    public int f2;
    public int f3;
    public int f4;
    public int f5;
    public int f6;
    public int f7;
    public int f8;

    public static NumericStruct build() {
      NumericStruct struct = new NumericStruct();
      struct.f1 = 1;
      struct.f2 = 2;
      struct.f3 = 3;
      struct.f4 = 4;
      struct.f5 = 5;
      struct.f6 = 6;
      struct.f7 = 7;
      struct.f8 = 8;
      return struct;
    }
  }

  public static class NumericStructList {
    public List<NumericStruct> list;

    public static NumericStructList build() {
      NumericStructList structList = new NumericStructList();
      structList.list = new ArrayList<>(1000);
      for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        structList.list.add(NumericStruct.build());
      }
      return structList;
    }
```
